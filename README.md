# SuperPeterKart

A karting game based off of some particularly memorable moments from the classes of my computer science teacher.

## Installation

I don't have builds available yet, but you can download the repo and the Godot editor (v4.3) and run the project that way.

## Network games

For LAN multiplayer, create a game on one computer (making sure to enable Online Multiplayer in the game settings), and from every other computer, click Join Game and put in the IP address of the host computer. Everything should Just Work, and if it doesn't, submit an issue here. I wouldn't recommend exposing a server to the internet (I wouldn't trust my code to be secure, personally), but if you _really_ want to do that, I'll leave figuring out the port forwarding and all that as an exercise for you.
